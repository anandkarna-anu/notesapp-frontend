# Notes frontend

Notes frontend is a simple web application for saving notes. It is developed using React and Vite.
## Running the application on your own machine

You can easily try out the application on your own machine. The current version of the application is developed using Node version 22.3.0. For the best experience, it is recommended to use the same major version of Node, but the application will likely work with other Node versions as well.

Follow these steps to run the application:

1. Clone this repository to your own machine with the command `git clone https://github.com/anandkarna-anu/notesapp-frontend.git`

2. Navigate to the cloned repository with the command `cd notesapp-frontend`

3. Install the node modules with the command `npm install`

4. Start the application with the command `npm run dev`. By default, the application will start on port 5173, so it will be available at http://localhost:5173/

 the frontend is used with a [separate backend](https://github.com/anandkarna-anu/backend).
